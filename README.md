This was made as a part of my third year in university in godot to demonstrate the implementation of ai ideads into an RTS.

This is a demo that showcases the following features:
1. Automated workers with a control panel to shift their focus
2. All out attacks, allowing you to automatically attack a point with all units
3. Smart attack, allowing you to automatically declare an attack with a specified number of units per enemy
4. Smartt defend, will auto defend buildings with nearest units linked to the amount of units you want per enemy
